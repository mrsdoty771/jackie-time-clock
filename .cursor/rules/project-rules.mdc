# Jackie Time Clock: Project Rules

## 1. Folder Responsibilities
- **models/**: Only define data schemas (blueprints) here.
- **controllers/**: Put all business logic (the "thinking") and database queries here.
- **routes/**: Only define URL paths that point to controllers.
- **middleware/**: Put security checks and company-separation logic here.

## 2. Multi-Tenant Standard (The Apartment Building Rule)
- EVERY database query must include a `companyId` filter. 
- Company 1 (MVC) must never see Company 2 (ALF) data.

## 3. Code Quality
- Use async/await for all database calls.
- Never hardcode secrets; always use `process.env` (from the .env file).
- Keep functions small and clean.
